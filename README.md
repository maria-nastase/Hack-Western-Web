# Upright - Hack Western 11 | Winner of Best Use of Tempo Labs

## Inspiration
Upright is an iPhone app and website that detects when vulnerable users fall or get injured. Whether you fall off your bike on your way to work, skiing down a mountain, or going for a walk as an elderly person, Upright alerts your emergency contacts and with your location and the severity of the injury.

## What it does
1. The user installs the mobile app and has adds emergency contacts.
2. If the user gets injured/falls down/is part of a car crash, the app detects an anomaly by reading the phone's accelerometer data and categorizes its severity
3. Emergency contacts are notified via SMS of a problem, and are given cursory information with a URL for more details.
4. Emergency contacts can view a webpage with predictive injury classification, location, time, and the patient's history of injuries
